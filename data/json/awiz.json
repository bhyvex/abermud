Pillows of various sizes and colors are strewn\nall about here, but the dominating feature of this room is the large black\nfuton which sits against the far wall.  Built into the opposite wall is a\nstone fireplace which is surrounded by ceiling-high bookshelves.  As you\nglance at the bookshelves, you notice that the books range from topics in\nphilosophy and mathematics to the latest works of fiction...there are even\na few books here that you have never heard of before.  On the floor in front\nof the fireplace is a thick, plush black rug.  All in all, this seems the\nperfect place to spend the evening whether you would like to have some time\nfor yourself or invite a close friend or two over.\n",
